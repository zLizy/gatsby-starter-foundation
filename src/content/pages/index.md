I am a PhD student at the Web Information Systems group, Department of Software Technology, Faculty of EEMCS, Delft University of Technology. The PhD project belongs to the HyperEdge project with Cognizant. Iâ€™m supervised by Alessandro Bozzon and Asterios Katsifodimos. My research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and data analysis. In particular, my reserach investigates how to apply metadata of different artifacts (e.g., model, data, hardware settings) to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning workflows.
